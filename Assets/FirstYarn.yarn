Squirrel: Hey, who's that? Get out of here!

-> Bug: That's a rude way to greet someone. What did I ever do you to you?
	Squirrel: I guess you’re right, my apologies.
-> Bug: Sorry, I’ll get out of your way!
	Squirrel: Don't be so considerate! Show some backbone, you exoskeletal creature!

Bug: Well, it seems like you're looking for something. Did you lose anything?
Squirrel: Yeah, I've lost my blueberry muffin. I've searched high and low but still, nothing. If you find it, you'd better not run off with it!
Squirrel: Wait, you're distracting me! I still don't know what a bug like you is doing this high up in the tree!
->Bug: I'm on my way to prove my innocence to the birds.

->Bug: I'm on a sightseeing tour!
	Squirrel: I don't believe that for a second.

Squirrel: The birds, you say? That's an admirable goal, and certainly more important than my blueberry muffin. Sounds like a fun trunk trip too.
Bug: (He's changing his mind that quickly…?)
Squirrel: It sure would be fun to come along with you on a quest to the Canopy.
Squirrel: There's something about your eyes that tells me everything I need to know about you.
Squirrel: Their intensity…their drive…now that I take a closer look, I see you're actually a really trustworthy fellow!
Bug: We've barely spoken for 2 minutes. Weren't you just yelling at me to go away a couple dialogue boxes ago?
Squirrel: That may be so, but you've just got this aura about you...the longer I'm in your presence, the more I'm convinced...
Squirrel: I've made up my mind. I'm coming with you! You'll need my help. 
Squirrel: I can teach you some of my tricks for dashing. They've helped me out of more scrapes than I can count on both paws!
Bug: Gee…that'd be super! I could work on my agility, that's for sure.
Squirrel: Happy to help! Alright, let me walk you through the basics…

Bug: No, no, it's true . . . I just really want to see what this tree has to offer.
Squirrel: I still don't believe you. A little bug like you would never try to scale the tree, not with the birds always prowling around!
Bug: Okay . . . you're right. I'm actually on my way to the Canopy, to prove my innocence to the birds.

Squirrel: Hold down the Z key to dash. If you're dashing, you can run through sticky sap or on top of water. 
Squirrel: I try dashing in every part of my day. You never know what you might discover if you dash!

Bug: Is that a village over there?
Squirrel: It's my hometown. Acropolis. Greatest squirrel settlement this side of the Great Tree's Trunk.
Squirrel: They kicked me out because the bird queen wanted a bite of my muffin.
Squirrel: I wouldn't let her have it, of course. It was my Grandma Squirrel's last gift to me!
Squirrel: So, she declared me a threat to the throne and ordered my dismissal from here. If I show my face I'll be chased out with sharpened claws!
Bug: That's awful that the queen would do that to you. I'd heard stories of the birds' atrocities, but now that I've experienced them firsthand, I really get it.
Bug: I also got exiled from my home. They accused me of stealing an egg from one of their nests. So they burnt my village to the ground.
Bug: I wanted to help rebuild but Chief Arachna said I was "banished".
Bug: And all because of a stupid egg. What would I ever want with an egg? It's not like I could eat it with a live bird inside.
Squirrel: Well hey, what are the odds that us two outcasts would find each other? Seems like destiny wove our paths together.
Squirrel: Hey, I just thought of something! We both have bones to pick with the birdbrains. What if, when you're visiting the birds, I petition for my freedom too?
Bug: I'm not gonna stop you from getting a reward there too. Plus, you've been so helpful with your dashing lessons.
Squirrel: Huh, you're right. I've been so charitable and didn't expect anything in return! Well, I'm looking forward to it--when I'm through with those birdbrains, they'll HAVE to let me back home!
Squirrel: But that time hasn't come yet. Come on, let's keep moving before they spot my furry outlawed face.
