Squirrel: Hey, who's that? Get out of here!

-> Bug: That's a very rude thing to say to a stranger. Learn some manners!
	Squirrel: I guess you’re right, my apologies.
-> Bug: Sorry, I’ll get out of your way!
	Squirrel: Don't be so considerate! Show some backbone, you exoskeletal creature!

Bug: Well, it seems like you're looking for something. Did you lose anything?
Squirrel: Yeah, I've lost my blueberry muffin. I've searched high and low but still, nothing.
Bug: You lost your blueberry muffin? 
Bug: Couldn't you just cook some more?
Squirrel: It's not that simple!
Squirrel: There's only one blueberry muffin in the world that's good enough for my tastebuds! It's the kind that my Grandma Squirrel makes!
Bug: (Wonder how many Grandma Squirrels there are in this tree…)
Squirrel: Wait, you're distracting me! I still don't know what a bug like you is doing this high up in the tree!
->Bug: I'm on a journey to prove my innocence to the birds.

->Bug: I'm on a sightseeing tour!
	Squirrel: I don't believe that for a second.

Squirrel: The birds, you say?
Squirrel: That's an admirable goal, and certainly more important than my blueberry muffin.
Bug: (He's changing his mind that quickly…?)
Squirrel: Plus, I can search for my blueberry muffin any old time. I've got nothing but time!
Squirrel: But you, this mission of yours is pressing! You're running out of time!
Bug: I haven't even told you anything about my crime yet. 
Squirrel: Oh, I know. But there's something about your eyes that tells me everything I need to know about you.
Squirrel: Their intensity…their drive…why, I could sense your resolve from a mile away!
Squirrel: I've made up my mind. I'm coming with you!
Bug: Well, I certainly won't refuse…
Squirrel: It's a deal then! And you're lucky I'm joining you now. You see, I'm a pretty fast runner if I do say so myself.
Squirrel: I can teach you some of my tricks for dashing. They've helped me out of more scrapes that I can count on both paws!
Bug: Gee…that'd be super! I could work on my agility, that's for sure.
Squirrel: Happy to help! Alright, here's a bit of the basics…

Bug: You know . . . I just really want to see what this tree has to offer.
Squirrel: I still don't believe you. A little bug like you would never try to scale the tree, not with the birds always prowling around!
Bug: Okay . . . you're right. I'm actually trying to prove my innocence to the birds.

Squirrel: Hold down the Z key to dash.
Squirrel: If you're dashing, you can run through sticky sap or break through the wind.
Squirrel: I try dashing in every part of my day. You never know what you might discover if you dash!
